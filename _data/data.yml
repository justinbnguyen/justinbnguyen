    summary: |
      Hi! I am a second year [master's student](https://sph.uth.edu/campuses/houston) at UTHealth and a [research assistant](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~akorkut/#/home) at MD Anderson Cancer center, where I am studying biostatistics. My primary research mentor is [Dr. Anil Korkut](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/anil_korkut.html) of the department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biolgoy.

      Initially, I completed a bachelor's in kinesiology with the idea of becoming a clinician. Upon realizing my strong interests on the quantiative side of basic science research, I pivoted to biostatistics. I am hoping to pursue a doctorate in biostatistics following my master's.
